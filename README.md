# web3-bitcoin-app

When you are building something, it's important to know what people really want. So I decided to develop a demo app to use the bitcoin-package I build in [ant-design-web3](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-web3).

The idea is to write a profile page, including all the inscriptions and runes of user's wallet.

There may be marketplaces and mint tools in the future, just like other platforms.
